    <h2>Welcome to My Sneaker World!</h2>
    <p>
       Hey everyone my name is Vianey! Welcome to one of my biggest passions — sneaker collecting! I used to be a very obsessed sneakerhead, starting in middle school with over 30 pairs in my collection. Each sneaker holds a special meaning and represents something more than just style. This website is my way of sharing my love for sneakers with you, with interactive activities!</p>
